Just walked out of the theater and my brain is still doing cartwheels trying to process what I just witnessed in The Amateur. Firstly, do they really expect us to buy the premise, or was that more of a metaphor for all of us stumbling through life pretending we know what's going on? I mean, the protagonist... what a character. He's like if your uncle tried to solve a Rubik's cube while blindfolded and mildly tipsy.

Nothing makes sense but everything clicks in this weird absurd way. It's like, dude is just a regular guy, right? Yet here we are watching him peel layers back on some huge, messy conspiracy that feels like it was thrown together by a toddler with a penchant for espionage cliches. Does that even make sense? Probably not, but neither did half the plot twists that made my brain feel like scrambled eggs served on the sunniest morning I never asked for.

>The cinematography... man, it's got this vibe like a faded 90s postcard—sentimental but kind of gaudy. Or maybe it's just me being nostalgic for those days before everything went digital. The colors are, I dunno, almost too much? It's like if your grandma's wallpaper decided to stage an uprising. Kinda worked though, in an odd sandal-wearing-dad way. 

And what's the deal with that soundtrack? It felt like someone took my old Casio keyboard, pressed all the demo buttons simultaneously, and said, “This’ll do nicely.” Sarcastic thumbs up, but somehow I dug it? It's like eating potato chips dipped in Nutella—terrible idea but curiously satisfying.

Spoilers—why did they choose that ending? Do filmmakers get a kick out of dangling closure like a carrot on a stick? It's like they were going for profound, but hit random instead. Yet here I am thinking about downloading the movie for a rewatch just to torment myself further. Maybe there's a secret message if you play it backwards while standing on your head. 

```c
// What even was my takeaway?
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf(Unexpected plot // twist );
    return (maybe);
}
```

Why walk away with solid answers when you can walk away with the cognitive equivalent of stepping on Lego bricks? Might end up watching the movie again, just for the kicks. Or maybe it’s masochism. Who knows, but right now, I need a nap.
